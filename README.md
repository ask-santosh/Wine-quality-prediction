# Wine-quality-prediction

This problem statement defines exploratory data analysis(EDA) and compare different machine learning algorithm's accuracy on the basis of wine quality.
I have collected data from kaggle and applied 9 ML algorithms to monitor it's accuracy.

## Comparison Models Accuracy

After a series of experiments I found that Random Forest gives a good accuracy of 88% and K-NN gives second highest of 83% .
